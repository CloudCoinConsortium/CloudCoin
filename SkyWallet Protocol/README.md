# SKYWALLET PROTOCOL


The skywallet is a Cloud-Based private ledger built on the RAIDA. Because it is built on the RAIDA, it has data supremacy. 100% uptime. Like the Blockchain, it is pseudo anonymous. Everyone needs to have an account number to use it. People use a CloudCoin to log in. Every CloudCoin can be used as a Skywallet Account. People can have as many SkyWallets as they like. 

The purpose of the Skywallet is:
1. To allow people to securely store their coins in the Cloud so they are available on any device at any time and anywhere in the world. 
2. To allow people to receive authentic CloudCoins without file transfer. This is convenient for merchants who will be accepting CloudCoins as payments.
3. To allow people to send authentic Cloudier without file transfer. This is good for buying things.   
4. To allow people to have friendly addresses that are custom and easy to remember. 
5. To make change (break large denominations into smaller ones) within seconds. 
6. To allow people to store money in their minds. They must remember their wallet address and their debit card number and pin. 
7. To allow people to have debit cards which can be used at existing payment terminals used in stores. And to make online purchases. 
8. To allow people to "pay by whisper" so that transaction can be made by simply giving another person a password. 
9. To allow people to organize their funds into "envelopes" so they can monitor their spending. 
10. Support Bill Pay services. 


Features of the Skywallet:
1. Usability: Allows us to have online ATM machines that we can use to deposit, withdraw and transfer CloudCoins. Anyone who knows how to use an ATM machine knows how to do this. We can also use debit cards that every one is familiar with. Even your 70 year old grandpa can do it. 

2. Speed: Unless change is needed, depositing, withdrawing and transferring coins takes less than 2 seconds. If you need to break a coin to send the correct change, it will add about 6 seconds to the process. We are working on making this faster. 

3. Availability: The RAIDA is 100% available. We are adding the finishing touches to our CloudCoin Wallet that will make sure SkyWallet funds will always be there when needed. 

4. Fees: No fees! Low Energy Use: Very efficient. 

5. Privacy: Unlike CloudCoin, the Skywallet is not 100% private. Instead it is pseudo private. This means the there are account numbers (similar to the public keys of crypto) for people. However, unlike the Blockchain, this information is no available to the public. Only RAIDA Admins could possibly see it. 

6. Key recovery coming soon. 

7. Addressing: Skywallet using the DNS system to have addresses similar to email addresses. An email address may look like "Bill@Microsoft.com" and a SkyWallet address will look like "Bill.Skwyallet.com" The only difference is the Skywallets have no '@' sign. 


## Protocol


The Skywallet protocols can be devided into four different catagories. 
1. Trusted Transfer
2. Merchante Services
3. Donation Services
4. Change Maker Services

# The Trusted Transfer Services 

These services allow one person to pay another without the other person needed to "pown" the coins. This solution does create new problems: Keys can be lost and stolen. This means the keys become a central way of failure point just like the 
private keys of the blockchain. However, we are now working on a key recovery service that should be done by summer 2020.

## Send

The Send allows many coins to be authenticated at the same time but their PANs are generated by the RAIDA instead of the owner. 
This allows CloudCoins to be transfered from person to person with no powning neccessary.

rules: 
"to_sn" must be a number between 1 and 16,777,215 because it is the serial number of a CloudCoin that a user must own in order to retrieve the coins. 

"envelope_name" must not start or end with any white space character and must use only UTF-8 characters. All the Characters must be English Alphanumeric.

## ShowEnvelopes
An Envelope is a grouping of coins usally grouped by a transaction number, purchase order number, memo, account number. 
For transactions, the seller gives the buyer their account number and an envelope name (which could be a receipt number) so the receiver can 
determine where the money came from. 
This service allows the user to see the names of the envelopes that belong to their account id (The serial number of their ID coin).

Envelop names could be like:

"From Billy Williams"

"1Z 999 AA1 01 2345 6784"

"1836843d928347fb22c2142b49d772b5"

"Use this money to obey god & destroy tyrants" // up to 44 characters

## RenameTag

Rename Tag allows you to take an entire envelope and either change its name or move the entire contents into an existing envelope. This way, CloudCoins that have been
sent to you may be moved to a different envelope. A person may want to do this to protect themselves from a 
person trying to use the same envelope name over and over again to prove that they paid for something. This is because the envelope name can be used by the sender as a proof
of payment. The Rename Tag service also tells how much was in the envelope so the receiver can tell if they have been paid enough. 


Example GET asking to change the name of an tag or envelope. 
```

}
```


## Receive


The Receive service allows many coins to be downloaded from the RAIDA at the same time. The Receiver can download all of their
coins, or just some of there coins. But it must specify the coins it wants to download by serial number. This means 
the client will have to do a "ShowCoins" so they can get a list of the serial number that they have.
This allows the RAIDA to actaully store coins for people. The Receiver must supply proof that they are the owner.
They prove that they are the owner by supplying a serial number of a CloudCoin that they own (their account number) and the AN for that serial number. 
The RAIDA checks its tranfer table and starts giving coin until the amount of coins asked to be downloaded is reached. 


This allows CloudCoins to be transfered from person to bank with no powning necessary.

rules: 
"to_number" must be a number between 1 and 16,777,215 because it is the serial number of a CloudCoin that a user must own in order to retrieve the coins. 

"envelope_name" must not start or end with any white space character and must use only UTF-8 alpha numeric characters.

## VerifyPayment

Verify Payment allows a merchant to see if a payment was recieved, make sure the correct amount was recieved, move that payment to another envelope and provide change if needed. The merchant must have 
a special "change" envelope to issue change. 

payment_envelope is the tag that the sender has used when he sent money to the merchant. 

payment_expected is the number of CloudCoins that the sender was suppose to send. The merchant will check to see if the actual payment from the sender was correct. 

return_to_sn is the address that any change or refundes should be sent to. If the sender does not send enough money, they will get their money back at this account. If the
sender sends too much money then they will get the change back at this account. 

storage_envelope is the place that the senders payment will be moved to. This is done by renaming the envelope. 

Example GET asking to change the name of an tag or envelope.

## SendWithChange
This service allows you to send money from your account to another and make change if needed. 

This service requires an account that has a "public_change" envelope. Account SN 2 has a public_change envelope but any account could allow for one. 

The sender sends a note such as 250 to the public change agent. 

The public change agent breaks the 250 as specifeid and sends some to the payee and the rest back to the sender's account as change. 


The Send allows many coins to be authenticated at the same time but their PANs are generated by the RAIDA instead of the owner. 
This allows CloudCoins to be transfered from person to person with no powning necessary.

rules: 
"to_sn" must be a number between 1 and 16,777,215 because it is the serial number of a CloudCoin that a user must own in order to retrieve the coins. 

"envelope_name" must not start or end with any white space character and must use only UTF-8 characters. All the Characters must be English Alphanumeric.

## ReceiveWithChange

Not implemented yet. Expected to be finnished by Nov 15, 2020. This will look a lot like Receive but with the same extras as SendWithChange. 



## DonateToRAIDA
Not Implement yet. Not on development schedule.  

This allows people to donate CloudCoins to pay the costs of running the servers. 

People can donate as much as 400 coins. 

There is a folder on the RAIDA called the "Donations" folder. 

Example POST donating three coins to the RAIDA

## ShowChange

ShowChange service returns the serial numbers of CloudCoins that are the specified account's "public_change" folder.
This allows the client to request to make change from 25 different RAIDA but use the same 
Serial Number. Otherwise, every RAIDA could return a different SN and all the coins would be counterfeit.

Anyone can created an envelope named "public_change." It may make it easier on the server side to have five envelopes named "public_change_1s",
"public_change_5s", "public_change_25s", "public_change_100s" and "public_change_250s". 

Each of these envelopes will contain the denominations for that type of CloudCoin.

Example GET asking for specific CloudCoins
```
https://RAIDA1.CloudCoin.Global/service/show_change?sn=778832

```

## Change
Take one CloudCoin and turns it into many smaller ones.  This is almost exactly like Receive except that instead of providing authentication, coins are provided instead. 
The caller must suggest which SNs it would like to recieve as change. This means that in order to get change, 
the caller must use the "ShowChange" service to supply a list of SNs that it expects to get in return.

As a rule, it can be required that the client always ask for change as folows:
```

250:
    100x2
    25x1
    5x4
    1x5
    
100:
    25x3
    5x4
    1x5

25:
    5x4
    1x5

5:
    1x5
    
```
NOTE: The above combination ensure that the client will always have the correct change to make any transaction. 

The service will go to the "public_change" envelope for the account spedified and take the requested coins out of the transfer table and return the ANs requested. 


EXAMPLE GET SENDS ONE 250 NOTE AND REQUESTS THAT IT IS BROKEN INTO 2 100s and 2 25s. 
THE COINS TO BE RETURNED ARE SPECIFIED IN THE SNS[] PARAMETERS
```
https://s0.teleportnow.cc/service/change?nn=1&sn=16777202&an=8ae06de0f9ce4917b3309df71570f92c&denomination=250sns[]=13555555&sns[]=5966558&sns[]=5556665&sns[]=8887372

## Exchange
Not implemented yet. Not on development scheudle. 
This takes many smaller notes and exchanges them for one big note. 
The number of notes provided must add up to either 250, 100, 25 or 5.
This is almost exactly like Receive except that instead of providing authentication, coins are provided instead. 

The user must specify the big coin that they hope to get in return. This helps
the server check to see if it has that change. There are five return: 250,100,25 and 5 ( 1 is not a type).
