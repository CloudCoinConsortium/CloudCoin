CloudCoin
This repository provides standards and APIs for CloudCoin, RAIDA, and Skywallet
CloudCoin is a digital currency based on the Theory of Perfect Money. Like Cryptocurrencies, it has Data Supremacy meaning that it cannot be hacked, brought down by governments, or even corrupted by its own creators. CloudCoin gets its Data Supremacy in a way similar to how the DNS System gets its data supremacy. CloudCoins have several unique properties including:
1.	100% Private. No Accounts, Logins, Usernames, or Public Ledgers that track everything.
2.	Transacts in seconds. Only requires 25 Clouds to be updated in parallel.
3.	Globally Scalable. Like the DNS, there is a RAIDA Root Domain and RAIDA subdomains. These domains can handle the entire world's authentication activities.
4.	100% available. The RAIDA has never gone down since it was created in August 2016.
5.	Uses over 10,000 times less electricity than Blockchain. CloudCoin just updates databases. No expensive encryption needed.
6.	No Inflation. The amount of CloudCoins is fixed. Never increases or decreases. Sub Domains handle change and there can be an infinite number of fractions, but these do not create more nominal coins.
7.	Easy Addressing. Used with SkyWallet or another system, simply use a DNS name for your address such as Sean.Worthington.com
8.	Loss Prevention. Can be backed up and stored off-site automatically reducing the threat of loss. If you do lose your coins, you can file a lost coin report and get your coins back in 5 years.
9.	Theft Prevention. You can split your coins up and store them in different locations. This allows you to "not put all your eggs into one basket." This allows you to reduce the risk of theft.
10.	Data is separated from logic. This means you can do anything with CloudCoins including putting them into software such as accounting systems, banking systems, and our own Sky Wallet.
11.	Crossover currency. CloudCoins can go from the real world into the virtual world and video games. Then they can be brought out again.
12.	They can be embedded into digital goods such as jpeg images, mp4s, pdfs, in-game items so that those digital items can be owned and traded.
RAIDA
The Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents is a data structure that runs the new GRS (Global RAIDA System) that authenticates people, digital items, collectibles, and currencies such as CloudCoins. The owner of the CloudCoin can fix any synchronization problems that occur making the RAIDA self-healing. Should any of the RAIDA go down, new RAIDA can be brought in to replace them.
Sky Wallet
The Sky Wallet is a private ledger that has Data Supremacy. The Sky Wallet provides a wrapper around CloudCoins to make CloudCoins easier to send, receive store, and make change. The Sky Wallet provides pseudo-anonymous privacy, so it is less private than CloudCoin. But it makes it convenient to use CloudCoins.

	# SKYWALLET PROTOCOL


The skywallet is a Cloud-Based private ledger built on the RAIDA. Because it is built on the RAIDA, it has data supremacy. 100% uptime. Like the Blockchain, it is pseudo-anonymous. Everyone needs to have an account number to use it. People use a CloudCoin to log in. Every CloudCoin can be used as a Skywallet Account. People can have as many SkyWallets as they like. 

The purpose of the Skywallet is:
1. To allow people to securely store their coins in the Cloud so they are available on any device at any time and anywhere in the world. 
2. To allow people to receive authentic CloudCoins without file transfer. This is convenient for merchants who will be accepting CloudCoins as payments.
3. To allow people to send authentic CloudCoins without file transfer. This is good for buying things.   
4. To allow people to have friendly addresses that are custom and easy to remember. 
5. To make change (break large denominations into smaller ones) within seconds. 
6. To allow people to store money in their minds. They must remember their wallet address and their debit card number and pin. 
7. To allow people to have debit cards that can be used at existing payment terminals used in stores. And to make online purchases. 
8. To allow people to "pay by whisper" so that transactions can be made by simply giving another person a password. 
9. To allow people to organize their funds into "envelopes" so they can monitor their spending. 
10. Support Bill Pay services. 


Features of the Skywallet:
1. Usability: Allows us to have online ATM machines that we can use to deposit, withdraw, and transfer CloudCoins. Anyone who knows how to use an ATM machine knows how to do this. We can also use debit cards that everyone is familiar with. Even your 70-year-old grandpa can do it. 

2. Speed: Unless change is needed, depositing, withdrawing, and transferring coins takes less than 2 seconds. If you need to break a coin to send the correct change, it will add about 6 seconds to the process. We are working on making this faster. 

3. Availability: The RAIDA is 100% available. We are adding the finishing touches to our CloudCoin Wallet that will make sure SkyWallet funds will always be there when needed. 

4. Fees: No fees! Low Energy Use: Very efficient. 

5. Privacy: Unlike CloudCoin, the Skywallet is not 100% private. Instead, it is pseudo-private. This means the there are account numbers (similar to the public keys of crypto) for people. However, unlike the Blockchain, this information is no available to the public. Only RAIDA Admins could possibly see it. 

6. Key recovery coming soon. 

7. Addressing: Skywallet using the DNS system to have addresses similar to email addresses. An email address may look like "Bill@Microsoft.com" and a SkyWallet address will look like "Bill.Skwyallet.com" The only difference is the Skywallets have no '@' sign. 


## Protocol


The Skywallet protocols can be divided into four different categories. 
1. Trusted Transfer
2. Merchant Services
3. Donation Services
4. Change Maker Services

# The Trusted Transfer Services 

These services allow one person to pay another without the other person needed to "pown" the coins. This solution does create new problems: Keys can be lost and stolen. This means the keys become a central way of failure point just like the 
private keys of the blockchain. However, we are now working on a key recovery service that should be done by summer 2020.

## Send

The Send allows many coins to be sent from a user's hard drive to a Sky Wallet. 
This allows CloudCoins to be transferred from person to person with no powning necessary.

rules: 
"to_sn" must be a number between 1 and 16,777,215 because it is the serial number of a CloudCoin that a user must own in order to retrieve the coins. 

"envelope_name" must not start or end with any white space character and must use only UTF-8 characters. All the Characters must be English Alphanumeric.

}
```

## SendAgain

The Send Again solves a problem cased when a client sends a send request to the RAIDA but receives no response 'n'. Then it becomes uncertain if the coin has been sent or not. This service allows the client that has sent a RAIDA a send request but received no response the ability to try to send again. But, the send again request must be made within one hour of the original send request. 

So, if you send some coins to a skywallet address and you do not get any response from a RAIDA. Send the same information to "SendAgain" and it may fix the failed send. 


This will "fix" a coin that has not been fully sent to the RAIDA. The sending parameters are the same and the response is the same. See the send service for the request and response examples.  

## ShowTransferBalance

Example Request:
Note: All the parameters here are for the ID coin.

## Show Tag
An Envelope is a grouping of coins usually grouped by a transaction number, purchase order number, memo, account number. 
For transactions, the seller gives the buyer their account number and an envelope name (which could be a receipt number) so the receiver can 
determine where the money came from. 
This service allows the user to see the names of the envelopes that belong to their account id (The serial number of their ID coin).

Envelop names could be like:

"From Billy Williams"

"1Z 999 AA1 01 2345 6784"

"1836843d928347fb22c2142b49d772b5"

"Use this money to obey god & destroy tyrants" // up to 44 characters

## Show Coins With Tag

This service shows how many coins you have that are in an envelope that you specify. 
Each coin will be listed so that the person will know what they have. 

"envelope_name" must not start or end with any white space character and must use only UTF-8 characters. 

Example GET asking to see all the coins they own in the transfer file.

## Show

This service shows how many coins an account has in the Skywallet. 

It has three modes:
```
1. Breif mode. Sends serial numbers seperated with commas. b=t
2. Content mode. Returns information that would be handy to diplay the contents of a Skywallet including
the number of each denomination. The total value of the coins, The envelopes and how many 
coins each envelop has. The date of creation of each envelope. 
```

"tag" must not start or end with any white space character and must use only UTF-8 characters. 

Example GET in brief mode.

```



## RenameTag

Rename Tag allows you to take an entire envelope and either change its name or move the entire contents into an existing envelope. This way, CloudCoins that have been
sent to you may be moved to a different envelope. A person may want to do this to protect themselves from a 
person trying to use the same envelope name over and over again to prove that they paid for something. This is because the envelope name can be used by the sender as a proof
of payment. The Rename Tag service also tells how much was in the envelope so the receiver can tell if they have been paid enough. 


Example GET asking to change the name of an tag or envelope. 
```
https://s0.teleportnow.cc/service/rename_tag?
nn=1&
sn=1&
an=1836843d928347fb22c2142b49d772b5&

}
```

## ViewReceipt  

This allows the sender and receiver of a payment to verify that the receiver received the payment. The sender w must use a guid as a memo and must give this guid to the merchant. The tag may be generated by the merchant or the customer.   The merchant then can call View Receipt and see if the total matches the required amount. The merchant can then use the list of coins returned to receive them, transfer them or rename their envelope.

SAMPLE CALL

```http
https://raida7.cloudcoin.global/service/view_receipt?account=2&tag=623e88186f3c4a4694c02230abe72666
```
PARAMETERS

1. tag: guid used in the memo of the transaction (MUST BE A GUID)
2. account: Serial Number of the ID coin that owns the receiving account .

SAMPLE RESPONSE IF COINS FOUND

```json
{
	"server": "raida18",
	"total_received": 454,
	"serial_numbers": "1308799, 1308800, 1308868, 1308983, 14339990, 14340140, 16458252",

	"execution_time": 0.0022211554454
}
```
NOTE: You will not that there was not results because the total will be = 0;

## Fix_Transfer

The fix_transfer service allows you to fix a raida that is not synced with the other RAIDA. With fix_transfer, you are telling the RAIDA to syncronize with its trusted neighbors. Assuming the neighbours agree, the RAIDA will change its status. You should allways call fix_transfer after issuing any command that results in a fracked Skywallet. This service can be called after send, receive, break, break in bank, show, show_change, and all the services where the client can see un synctonized responses. The client must choose a corner that will be fixable. Or the client can pick a random corner between 1 and 4. 

rules: 

"sn[]" must be a number between 1 and 16,777,215 because it is the serial number of a CloudCoin that a user must own in order to retrieve the coins. 

The maximum coins you can send are 2000. 

EXAMPLE POST REQUESTING 
```
    https://raida11.cloudcoin.global/service/sync/fix_transfer?
    sn[]=145895&sn[]=66585&sn[]=16589554
    
 ```

EXAMPLE RESPONSE (You will just receive one word: done)
```
    done 

```

## Receive

NOTE: Only the first five bytes of the AN are needed to receive. This allows you to grant a "Receive Key" so that a person with this key can only
receive and do some other show functions. They would not be able to transfer. People would also need the second five bytes to be able to 
get the SNS needed. 

The Receive service allows many coins to be downloaded from the Sky Wallet at the same time. The Receiver can download all of their
coins, or just some of their coins. But it must specify the coins it wants to download by serial number. This means 
the client will have to do a "Show" so they can get a list of the serial number that they have.
This allows the RAIDA to actaully store coins for people. The Receiver must supply proof that they are the owner.
They prove that they are the owner by supplying a serial number of a CloudCoin that they own (their account number) and the AN for that serial number. 
The RAIDA checks its tranfer table and starts giving coin until the amount of coins asked to be downloaded is reached. 

This allows CloudCoins to be transfered from person to bank with no powning necessary.

rules: 
"to_number" must be a number between 1 and 16,777,215 because it is the serial number of a CloudCoin that a user must own in order to retrieve the coins. 

The pang is used as a seed to calculate an AN so that the client does not have to download it. 
```php
$seed2 = THIS_NODE_NUMBER.$sn.$pang;
$pan = md5($seed2);

```

## Receive Envelope


NOTE: Only the first five bytes of the AN are needed to receive. This allows you to grant a "Receive Key" so that a person with this key can only receive and do some other show functions. They would not be able to transfer. People would also need the second five bytes to be able to 
get the SNS needed. 

The Receive Envelope service allows up to a maximum amount (such as 400 coinst) to all be downloaded at once.  The Receiver can download all of their coins from an envelope by calling the Receive Envelope Script over and over until the status is "done"

The pang is used as a seed to calculate an AN so that the client does not have to download it. 
```php
$seed2 = THIS_NODE_NUMBER.$sn.$pang;
$pan = md5($seed2);

## ShowChange

ShowChange service returns the serial numbers of CloudCoins that are the specified account's "public_change" folder.
This allows the client to request to make change from 25 different RAIDA but use the same 
Serial Number. Otherwise, every RAIDA could return a different SN and all the coins would be counterfeit.

Anyone can created an envelope named "public_change." It may make it easier on the server side to have five envelopes named "public_change_1s",
"public_change_5s", "public_change_25s", "public_change_100s" and "public_change_250s". 

Each of these envelopes will contain the denominations for that type of CloudCoin.

## Break
Take one CloudCoin note that is on the user's hard drive and turns it into many smaller notes. The caller must suggest which SNs it would like to recieve as change. This means that in order to get change, the caller must use the "ShowChange" service to supply a list of SNs that it expects to get in return. As a rule, it can be required that the client always ask for change as folows:
