# QR Codes

The QR codes are designed to hold a bunch of data in a small size so that it is easy to read and easy to place on paper or packaging. 

The QR code uses the method of generating PANs based on a seed in the QR code. To turn the coin into a CloudCoin you must be able to run an algorithm against it.
