# AOID ( All Other Information Desired )

The AOID is part of the CloudCoin that allows the coin to be extensible. The AOID is a an array of strings. 



## One Standard single key value pair. 

"aoid":["id=sean.cloudoin.global"]

## Two Standard single key value pair. 

"aoid":["email=CloudCoin@protonamil.com","phone=(523)955-9854"]

## One multi key value pair. 
Do not do this: 
"aoid":["owner=Bill&owner=Betty"]

Here we hae two people who own the coin (Bill and Betty) and they have the same key but different values. 
Do this:
"aoid":["owner=Bill,Betty"]


## Serial Single key. 

"aoid":["shuffle=3,20,22,15,24,10,1,11,12,23,17,14,4,13,5,8,2,19,0,16,6,9,7,18,21"]

Here we see that the coin shuffles the ANs so they go on different RAIDA. This is encryption.
