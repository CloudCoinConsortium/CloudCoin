# RECEIVING AND SENDING CLOUDCOINS PROGRAMMATICALLY

You can receive and send CloudCoins by either using CloudCoin Wallet or Skywallet. CloudCoin Wallet runs on your desktop or server while Skywallet is in the RAIDA Cloud. The CloudCoin Wallet provides 100% anonymous transactions but is less convenient. Skywallet provides pseudo-privacy that is like crypto currencies. Unlike crypto, Skywallet transactions are not public. This means that the only people who could possibly see your SkyWallet Transactions are RAIDA Administrators. SkyWallet makes sending and receiving payments very convenient. 

# Receiving And Verifying Payments
The easiest way to receive and confirm payment is by having your customers send CloudCoins to your SkyWallet account and then call the "View_Receipt" service to verify that they sent the payment. Your customer can use their CloudBank Wallet, the SkyWallet ATM or your custom webpage using our sample store to send payment using the RaidaJS javascript API.

PARAMETERS
```
tag: guid used in the memo of the transaction (MUST BE A GUID). 
account: Serial Number of your SkyWallet ID coin.
```
NOTES ON PARAMETERS

Tag: The GUID can be generated by your customer or you can tell the customer what the GUID will be.  

Account: You can get this by looking in the ID folder on your CloudCoin Wallet and then opening your ID coin in a text editor. You must first have a SkyWallet account which can be created using the CloudCoin Wallet. To make things easier, we convert these numbers into IP addresses and then store them on DNS servers so that we can use friendly names that are easy to use and provide confidence in transactions. For example, if you owned Walmart, you would want to want to convert your skyWallet account number to an IP and put it on Walmart DNS servers. So then your user SkyWallet account may be "payments.Walmart.com" and this would translate to IP address 1.232.70.172. If you convert that IP address to a decimal, it becomes 15222444. Because only you have access to the Walmart DNS servers, it proves that Walmart is the owner of account 15222444 and that it is safe to send money there.   

EVALUATING RAIDA RESPONSES
You must call the "view_receipt" service on 25 RAIDA in parallel. As a simple rule, you need 20 responses confirming the total to be certain that you received payment. However, if you use "Advanced Grading" you can be safe with 16 positive responses or less.

# Sending Coins

Your customers may want to download coins from your website. Or they might want to receive them in an email. If they have a Skywallet Account, they may like to have them sent there. You may also want to give them a link that allows the to download their coins. 

The easyist way is to send Coins to your customers is to use CloudCoin Wallet with RPC. Download the CloudCoin Wallet and run it on your desktop computer or server. It will run on any platform with a GUI.  You will need to enable CloudCoin Wallet RPC (Remote Procedure Calls). This allows your web servers to command your CloudCoin Wallet to give it a stack of CloudCoins.You can then put these coins on your website and email the coins to your customers.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
```
amount: The amount of CloudCoins to be returned in the stack.
pk: The password that your CloudBank has generated for you. 
account: The account ID that your CloudBank has generated for you.
```
OPTIONAL   PARAMETERS
```
ek: The password used to decrypt your CloudCoin Wallet. This is needed if you have choosen to password protect your wallet. 
base64: A memo or note that will be placed in the transaction file on the CloudCoin Wallet. 
```

Your Wallet will automatically make change if needed. You can put your CloudCoin Wallet on a server located in a physically secure place (like your home). You can even have lots of CloudCoin Wallets on different machines around the world to mitigate the risk of theft and loss. You can encrypt your Wallet so that the person who is the custodian/administrator of the CloudCoin Wallet does not have the ability to rob them. In the future, the CloudCoin Wallet with CloudBank will allow you to configure limits on sending money, restrictions on who can request money, times of day that money can be sent and even if you want manual confirmation.

Once your server gets your stack file, it can put it on a web page, stored with a link for the customer to download, emailed to the user or even turned into a QR code, png or jpeg file (using the RAIDA class functions in the RaidaJs.js).

# Other Ways to Send and Receive

### Skywallet to Skywallet using "Transfer.go"
If you want to sent CloudCoins directly from your SkyWallet to a customer's SkyWallet you can use our "Transfer.go" program that can be called from any language. However, this "Transfer.go" program is still in Alpha but it may be done by the time you read this.

### Skywallet to Skywallet using CloudCoin Wallet
If you want to command you CloudWallet CloudBank to transfer funds from your SkyWallet you can use our "Transfer" RPC. This is under deveoplpment. 

### CloudCoin Wallet to Skywallet using RPC
If you want to command your CloudWallet CloudBank to send CloudCoins from your local wallet to a SkyWallet, you can use our "SendToSkyWallet" CloudBank service. This is underdevelopment. 

### Accepting Skywallet Debit Card for Skywallet to Skywallet
You can accept a Skywallet Debit Card in the near future. It will allow a web page to transfer coins from their Skywallet to yours. 

## Other API
The CloudBank is designed to allow you to do all the things that the CloudCoin Wallet can do through remote procedure calls. We have APIs written in Java, JavaScript, Python, C# and Unity, C++, Unreal Engine, GoDot, Ruby and others. These APIs allow you to control your CloudBank remotly. We also have the RaidaJS API that allows you to access Skywallet via Javascript.  Most of these APIs need some work. If you have need for APIs in these languages, let us know so we can However, they are not well developed. We can schedule them to be improved and ready for use.
