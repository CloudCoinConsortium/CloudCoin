NOTE THAT THIS IS FOR CLOUDCOIN VERSION 1. CLOUDCOIN IS NOW ON VERSION 3. 
CloudCoin
This repository provides standards and APIs for CloudCoin, RAIDA, and Skywallet
CloudCoin is a digital currency based on the Theory of Perfect Money. Like Cryptocurrencies, it has Data Supremacy meaning that it cannot be hacked, brought down by governments, or even corrupted by its own creators. CloudCoin gets its Data Supremacy in a way similar to how the DNS System gets its data supremacy. CloudCoins have several unique properties including:
1.	100% Private. No Accounts, Logins, Usernames, or Public Ledgers that track everything.
2.	Transacts in seconds. Only requires 25 Clouds to be updated in parallel.
3.	Globally Scalable. Like the DNS, there is a RAIDA Root Domain and RAIDA subdomains. These domains can handle the entire world's authentication activities.
4.	100% available. The RAIDA has never gone down since it was created in August 2016.
5.	Uses over 10,000 times less electricity than Blockchain. CloudCoin just updates databases. No expensive encryption needed.
6.	No Inflation. The amount of CloudCoins is fixed. Never increases or decreases. Sub Domains handle change and there can be an infinite number of fractions, but these do not create more nominal coins.
7.	Easy Addressing. Used with SkyWallet or another system, simply use a DNS name for your address such as Sean.Worthington.com
8.	Loss Prevention. Can be backed up and stored off-site automatically reducing the threat of loss. If you do lose your coins, you can file a lost coin report and get your coins back in 5 years.
9.	Theft Prevention. You can split your coins up and store them in different locations. This allows you to "not put all your eggs into one basket." This allows you to reduce the risk of theft.
10.	Data is separated from logic. This means you can do anything with CloudCoins including putting them into software such as accounting systems, banking systems, and our own Sky Wallet.
11.	Crossover currency. CloudCoins can go from the real world into the virtual world and video games. Then they can be brought out again.
12.	They can be embedded into digital goods such as jpeg images, mp4s, pdfs, in-game items so that those digital items can be owned and traded.
RAIDA
The Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents is a data structure that runs the new GRS (Global RAIDA System) that authenticates people, digital items, collectibles, and currencies such as CloudCoins. The owner of the CloudCoin can fix any synchronization problems that occur making the RAIDA self-healing. Should any of the RAIDA go down, new RAIDA can be brought in to replace them.
Sky Wallet
The Sky Wallet is a private ledger that has Data Supremacy. The Sky Wallet provides a wrapper around CloudCoins to make CloudCoins easier to send, receive store, and make change. The Sky Wallet provides pseudo-anonymous privacy, so it is less private than CloudCoin. But it makes it convenient to use CloudCoins.
