# CloudCoin
This repository provides standards and APIs for CloudCoin, RAIDA and Skywallet

CloudCoin is a digital currency based on the Theory of Pefect Money. Like Crypto currencies it has Data Supremacy meaning that it cannot be hacked, brought down by governments or even corupted by its own creators. CloudCoin gets its Data Supremacy in a way simular to how the DNS System gets its datasupremacy. CoudCoins have several unique properties including: 

1. 100% Private. No Accounts, Logins, Usernames or Public Ledgers that track everything. 

2. Transacts in seconds. Only requires 25 Clouds to be updated in parallel. 

3. Globally Scalable. Like the DNS, there is a RAIDA Root Domain and RAIDA subdomins. These domains can handle the entire world's authentication activities. 

4. 100% availabe. The RAIDA has never gone down since it was created in August 2016.

5. Uses over 10,000 times the elecrticiy than Blockchain. CloudCoin just updates databases. No expensive encryption needed.

6. No Inflation. The amount of CloudCoins is fixed. Never increases or decreases. Sub Domains handle change and there can be an infinte number of fractions. 

7. Easy Addressing. Used with SkyWallet or other system, simply use a DNS name for your address such as Sean.Worthington.com

9. Loss Prevention. Can be backed up and stored off site automatically reducing the threat of loss. If you do lose your coins, you can file a lost coin report and get your coins back in 5 years. 

10. Theft Prevention.You can split your coins up and store them in different locations. This allows you to "not put all your eggs into one basket." This allows you to reduce the risk of theft. 

11. Data is seperated from logic. This means you can do anything with CloudCoins including putting them into software such as accounting systems and banking systems. 

12. Crossover currency. CloudCoins can go from the real world into the virtual world and video games. Then they can be brought out again. 

13. They can be embedded into digital goods such as jpeg images, mp4s, pdfs, in-game items so that those digital items can be owned and traded. 


## RAIDA
The Redundant Array of Independent Detection Agents is a data structure that authenticates CloudCoins. The owner of the CloudCoin can also fix any problems that occure making the RAIDA self healing. Should any of the RAIDA go down, new RAIDA can be brought in to replace them. 

## Skywallet

The Skywallet is a private ledger that has Data Supremacy. The Skywallet provides a layer around CloudCoins to make CloudCoins easier to send, receive, store and make change.
