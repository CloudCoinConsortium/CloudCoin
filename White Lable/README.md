# Detailed instructions

## 1. Download the CloudCoin Wallet
If you have not already done so, download the latest Dark version of the CloudCoin Wallet from  https://cloudcoinconsortium.com/use.html. The wallet must have a version higher than 2.1.38. This is an example of the file name: CloudCoin.D.2.1.38.jar. Place this file on your desktop or somewhere you will remember it. 

## 2. Open the CloudCoin Wallet and create a wallet. 
If you havn't already done so, open the newly downloaded wallet and let it download the default content. Agree to the terms and then create a wallet. Name the wallet what ever you like. 

## 3. Close the CloudCoin Wallet. 
Close the CloudCoin Wallet so you can rename the file and change the contents. 

## 4. Rename the CloudCoin Wallet jar file so that "CloudCoin" is replaced by your coin's name.

Suppose you have a coin named "CoolCoin", take your CloudCoin Wallet file and rename it so that the first part of the file name is CoolCoin. So if your CloudCoin Wallet is called: "CloudCoin.D.2.1.38.jar" then rename it CoolCoin.D.2.1.38.jar". Please use only lowercase characters and no spaces or special characters.  

## 5. Go in the Brands subfolder and create a new folder with your coin's name.

On windows you can find the Brands folder at: 
```
C:\Users\yourusername\CloudCoinWallet\
```
Within the Brands folder, create a new folder that is the exact name the you renamed the progrm to. So if you coin is called "coolcoin" then you would create a folder within the Brands folder and call it "coolcoin".

## 6. Copy everything from the CloudCoin folder in the brands folder to your coins' folder. Now you can edit all the contents there.

## 9. Upload your content to Wallet Server or distribute the file. 

Now  you are ready to distribute your wallet to your users. There are two ways to do this. One way is to send people the wallet.x.x.x.jar file and the CloudCoinWallet folder. This is more tricky for the user because they must put the CloudCoinWallet folder in the right place for it to work.  They must put this folder here: C:\Users\yourusername\CloudCoinWallet\

Another way is to pay 15,000 CloudCoins to have your content posted on RAIDATech's webserver so that it can be downloaded automaticaly the first time your user opens the file. RAIDATech may not agree to have your wallet on their server. Send you brand folder zipped up and 15,000 CloudCoins to CloudCoin@Protonmail.com to have your wallet info included. Then send you wallet to everyone and the brand will be downloaded based on the first word in the name of your wallet jar file.
